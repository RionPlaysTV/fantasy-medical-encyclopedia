**🧬 Lifespan:**  
70-90 years (varies significantly by region, lifestyle, and magical exposure. Some bloodlines with draconic heritage may reach 120+ years.)

**📏 Physical Characteristics:**  
Medium-sized bipedal humanoids, typically 5-6 feet in height. Highly variable in skin tone, hair color, and build. Notable for their adaptability and lack of specialized physical features—what scholars term "evolutionary flexibility." Possess opposable thumbs and complex vocal cords enabling sophisticated tool use and communication.

**🫀 Cardiovascular & Respiratory Systems:**  
Standard four-chambered heart with 60-100 bpm at rest. Single-lung breathing system vulnerable to magical toxins but remarkably adaptable to various atmospheric conditions. Heart rate increases dramatically under magical stress—a useful diagnostic indicator for curse detection.

**🩺 Common Ailments & Vulnerabilities:**  
- **Magical Exhaustion Syndrome:** Overuse of magical items causes fatigue and temporary memory loss
- **Iron Deficiency:** Particularly common in areas with high fae activity
- **Lycanthropic Susceptibility:** Higher infection rates than most species during full moons
- **Plague Vulnerability:** Especially to necromantic diseases
- **Stress-induced magical fluctuations** affecting nearby enchanted items

**✨ Magical Anomalies / Biological Adaptations:**  
Most humans possess latent magical capacity (1-3% exhibit active abilities). Rare individuals show "null magic" immunity—both blessing and curse. Bloodlines mixed with other species often manifest: enhanced longevity (draconic), night vision (elven), or enhanced constitution (dwarven). Remarkably, human magical potential often increases near ley lines.

**🧪 Healing Response:**  
Excellent response to divine healing and standard healing potions. Moderate tolerance to alchemical treatments. **WARNING:** Humans metabolize enchanted substances 40% faster than elves—adjust dosages accordingly. Exceptional compatibility with magical prosthetics and healing crystals.

**🥼 Crossbreeding Compatibility:**  
Highly compatible with most humanoid species. Known viable crosses include:
- **Half-elves:** Generally healthy, inherit elven longevity and human adaptability
- **Half-orcs:** Robust constitution but may require specialized birthing assistance
- **Tiefling bloodlines:** Magical complications possible; recommend prenatal divination
- **Draconic heritage:** Rare but typically results in enhanced magical resistance

**🧂 Allergies / Magical Toxins:**  
- **Cold iron:** Causes skin irritation in magically sensitive individuals
- **Unicorn hair:** Paradoxically toxic to "pure-hearted" humans (causes severe allergic reactions)
- **Powdered vampire fang:** Universally lethal—avoid at all costs
- **Concentrated fae essence:** Can cause temporary madness or permanent magical addiction
- **Necromantic residue:** Lingering exposure leads to "soul fade" syndrome

**🌿 Cultural Medical Practices:**  
Practices vary wildly by region. Common approaches include:
- **Temple healing:** Divine magic preferred for serious ailments
- **Herb-craft:** Traditional remedies often surprisingly effective
- **Barber-surgeons:** Mundane medical practices mixed with minor healing magic
- **Magical insurance policies:** Growing trend in major cities
- **Ancestor consultation:** Spiritual healing through medium contact

**📓 Scholar's Notes:**  
*"The human body remains medicine's greatest puzzle—simultaneously the most fragile and most resilient patient base. I've seen humans survive curses that would fell an orc, yet watched others succumb to minor magical exposure. Their psychological state dramatically affects physical healing; a hopeful human heals 60% faster than a despondent one."*

*—Archmedicus Theren Goldleaf, Chief Healer of the Transcendental Medical College*

**Clinical Observation:** Humans uniquely benefit from "hybrid" treatment approaches combining magical and mundane medicine. Always inquire about family magical history—dormant bloodlines can cause unexpected reactions to standard treatments.

**Emergency Protocol:** For unconscious humans of unknown origin, assume moderate magical sensitivity and begin with minimal-dose healing potions while checking for signs of fae-touched or celestial heritage.
