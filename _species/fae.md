title: "Fae"
layout: species
lifespan: "Immortal (barring violence or iron poisoning)"
---

**üß¨ Lifespan:**  
Immortal under normal circumstances. True death typically results from iron poisoning, cold iron weapons, or voluntary dissolution when separated from their Courts for extended periods (200+ years). Some Lesser Fae may experience "seasonal mortality" tied to natural cycles.

**üìè Physical Characteristics:**  
Highly variable‚Äîshape-shifting abilities make standard measurements impossible. Common forms range from 3 inches (pixies) to 8 feet (some Greater Fae). Distinguishing features include: otherworldly beauty, eyes that reflect light unusually, and slight luminescence in darkness. Physical forms shift with emotions, seasons, and magical strength.

**ü´Ä Cardiovascular & Respiratory Systems:**  
**WARNING: Fae physiology defies conventional understanding.** No consistent cardiovascular structure‚Äîsome appear to have crystalline heart-analogues, others show pure magical energy circulation. "Breathing" serves primarily for speech and scent detection rather than oxygen intake. Life force sustained directly by magical energy and emotional resonance.

**ü©∫ Common Ailments & Vulnerabilities:**  
- **Iron Poisoning:** Fatal within hours of significant exposure
- **Oath Breaking Syndrome:** Violating sworn agreements causes severe physical deterioration
- **Seasonal Displacement Disorder:** Symptoms worsen when separated from appropriate seasonal Courts
- **Truth Sickness:** Forced honesty causes literal physical pain and potential magical backlash
- **Memory Fragmentation:** Ancient Fae may lose cohesive self-identity across centuries
- **Mortality Fixation:** Rare condition where Fae become obsessed with experiencing death

**‚ú® Magical Anomalies / Biological Adaptations:**  
Pure magical beings with reality-altering capabilities. Specialized abilities include:
- **Glamour Projection:** Altering others' perceptions of reality
- **Dimensional Shifting:** Limited movement between planes
- **Emotion Manipulation:** Affecting mortal psychological states
- **Time Dilation:** Subjective time experience varies dramatically
- **Nature Command:** Control over natural elements (varies by Court affiliation)

**WARNING:** Fae magic can rewrite local reality. Maintain iron barriers during treatment to prevent unconscious magical interference with medical procedures.

**üß™ Healing Response:**  
**CRITICAL MEDICAL ALERT:** Standard healing methods are often ineffective or harmful to Fae physiology. Recommended approaches:
- **Bargained Healing:** Fae may require "payment" for accepting treatment (knowledge, favors, memories)
- **Seasonal Remedies:** Align treatments with Fae's Court season for maximum effectiveness
- **Emotional Resonance Therapy:** Healing through music, poetry, or artistic expression
- **Natural Magic:** Plant-based remedies and crystal resonance show promise
- **NEVER USE:** Iron-based instruments, blessed items from mortal religions, or synthetic magical healing

**ü•º Crossbreeding Compatibility:**  
- **Human-Fae (Changelings):** Unstable but possible‚Äîoffspring often struggle with dual nature
- **Elf-Fae crosses:** Rare and typically results in enhanced magical abilities but shortened lifespan
- **Other species:** Generally incompatible due to fundamental physiological differences

**Note:** Fae "reproduction" may not follow biological norms‚Äîsome offspring are created through magical bargains or seasonal rituals rather than conventional means.

**üßÇ Allergies / Magical Toxins:**  
- **Iron (all forms):** Universally lethal‚Äîeven trace amounts cause severe burns
- **Cold Iron:** Specially forged iron that prevents magical healing and causes permanent damage
- **Religious Symbols:** Divine magic from mortal religions causes discomfort to pain
- **Synthetic Magic:** Artificially created magical items disrupt Fae magical patterns
- **Broken Oaths:** Exposure to oath-breakers can cause sympathetic magical illness
- **Mortal Disbelief:** Large-scale disbelief in Fae existence can weaken their physical coherence

**üåø Cultural Medical Practices:**  
- **Court Healing Circles:** Communal magical healing involving entire Fae communities
- **Seasonal Renewal Rituals:** Quarterly ceremonies to refresh magical vitality
- **Bargain Medicine:** Healing through formal magical contracts and exchanges
- **Dream Therapy:** Entering patients' dreams to address psychological magical ailments
- **Dance Healing:** Choreographed magical movements that restore balance
- **Story Medicine:** Healing through narrative‚Äîchanging personal stories to alter reality

**üìì Scholar's Notes:**  
*"Treating Fae patients requires abandoning everything you think you know about medicine. I once spent three days negotiating the terms under which a Greater Fae would allow me to examine a cursed wound. The 'examination' consisted of me composing a sonnet about the beauty of their suffering. The wound healed immediately upon completion."*

*‚ÄîDr. Evangeline Morrigan, Specialist in Otherworldly Medicine*

**Clinical Observation:** Fae patients often view illness as a temporary interesting experience rather than something to be immediately cured. They may be more interested in the aesthetic or emotional aspects of their condition than in practical healing. Approach with patience and creativity.

**Emergency Protocol:** 
1. **Remove all iron immediately** from patient area
2. **Establish formal consent** through proper Fae etiquette 
3. **Determine Court affiliation** and seasonal alignment
4. **Avoid direct commands**‚Äîphrase all instructions as requests or suggestions
5. **Prepare for reality fluctuations** during treatment
6. **Have artistic or musical payment ready** in case Fae demands compensation for healing

**NEVER:** Attempt to physically restrain a Fae patient‚Äîthis may trigger reality-altering defensive responses that could endanger everyone present.
