</div>

## ü´Ä Cardiovascular System

### Feline-Specific Adaptations
- **Resting heart rate**: 80-120 BPM (increases to 180+ during hunt state)
- **Blood pressure**: Elevated baseline to support rapid acceleration
- **Cardiac output**: 150% human capacity during peak activity
- **Recovery time**: Rapid return to baseline after exertion

### Hunt State Physiology
During heightened awareness or hunting behavior:
- Heart rate increases by 50-100%
- Blood flow redirected to muscles and brain
- Pupils dilate significantly
- Breathing becomes shallow and controlled

**Medical Consideration**: Never startle a Felidae Beastkin during examination. Sudden hunt state activation can cause cardiovascular stress.

## ü©∫ Common Medical Conditions

- **Stealth magic**: Natural synergy, duration extended by 200%
- **Divination**: Strong intuitive responses to future-sight spells
- **Luck magic**: Peculiar attraction to probability-altering spells

### Magical Sensitivities
- **Water magic**: Instinctive aversion, reduced effectiveness
- **Canine-based magic**: Can cause involuntary territorial responses
- **Binding spells**: Psychological distress, claustrophobic reactions

<div class="medical-alert warning">
‚ö†Ô∏è **Magical Warning**: Felidae Beastkin have unpredictable reactions to teleportation magic. Always use *Motion Sickness* prevention before magical transport.
</div>

## üß™ Pharmaceutical Considerations

### Toxic Substances (Critical Avoidance)
- **Valerian Root**: Causes euphoria followed by dangerous sedation
- **Nightshade derivatives**: Extreme toxicity, potential fatality
- **Chocolate compounds**: Cardiac arrhythmia, seizures
- **Essential oils** (concentrated): Respiratory distress, liver damage

### Enhanced Effectiveness
- **Pain relief potions**: 200% effectiveness compared to human doses
- **Healing salves**: Rapid absorption through enhanced circulation
- **Energy restoration**: Metabolizes 150% faster than other species

### Dosage Adjustments
- **Standard medications**: Reduce to 70-80% human dose initially
- **Sedatives**: Highly unpredictable - start with minimal doses
- **Stimulants**: Often unnecessary due to natural energy levels

## ü•º Examination Protocols

### Pre-Examination Preparation
1. **Environment**: Ensure quiet, warm room with escape routes visible
2. **Approach**: Move slowly, avoid direct staring
3. **Consent**: Always ask permission before touching, especially ears/tail
4. **Positioning**: Allow patient to choose comfortable position

### Examination Techniques
- **Gentle touch**: Feline Beastkin respond poorly to firm pressure
- **Respect boundaries**: Many have strong personal space requirements
- **Watch for purring**: Indicates comfort, continue current approach
- **Monitor ears**: Flattened ears indicate stress or discomfort

### Emergency Examination
If patient is in animal form:
- Approach from the side, never head-on
- Use calm, low voice tones
- Offer back of hand for scenting before contact
- Be prepared for flight response

## üßÇ Nutritional Requirements

### Dietary Essentials
- **Protein**: 65-70% of total caloric intake
- **Taurine**: Essential amino acid, deficiency causes heart problems
- **Arachidonic acid**: Required fatty acid for skin and coat health
- **Vitamin A**: Higher requirements than other species
- **Water**: Often prefer running water, may reject stagnant sources

### Meal Patterns
- **Frequency**: 4-6 small meals preferred over large meals
- **Temperature**: Prefer room temperature or slightly warm food
- **Texture**: Many prefer varied textures within meals
- **Hunting supplements**: Benefit from occasional "hunt" for mental health

### Dietary Restrictions
- **Carbohydrates**: Limited processing ability, maximum 15% of diet
- **Plant matter**: Minimal nutritional benefit, may cause digestive upset
- **Dairy**: Most are lactose intolerant after weaning age
- **Fish bones**: Cooked bones dangerous, raw acceptable

<div class="medical-alert danger">
üö® **Nutritional Emergency**: Signs of taurine deficiency include dilated cardiomyopathy and retinal degeneration. Requires immediate supplementation.

## üåø Traditional Feline Remedies

### Calming Treatments

**Catnip Anxiety Relief** (Use sparingly):
- *Nepeta cataria* in minimal doses (0.5g maximum)
- Provides temporary euphoria followed by calm state
- **Warning**: Can cause addiction-like behavior, limit to medical use only

**Purr Therapy**:
- Natural healing vibrations from purring (20-50 Hz)
- Accelerates bone healing, reduces blood pressure
- Can be induced through gentle chin scratches and warm environments

### Digestive Aids

**Grass Supplement Blend**:
- Safe grasses: *Cat Grass*, *Wheat Grass*, *Barley Grass*
- Aids in hairball prevention and digestive health
- Fresh preferred, dried acceptable if fresh unavailable

**Grooming Assistance Oil**:
- *Safflower oil* with *Lavender* (feline-safe variety only)
- Applied to coat during shedding seasons
- Reduces excessive grooming and hairball formation

## üìì Scholar's Notes

*Felidae Beastkin have taught me more about patient psychology than any textbook. Their body language is incredibly expressive once you learn to read it. A twitching tail tip indicates annoyance, flattened ears show fear or aggression, and slow blinking is the highest form of trust.*

*I've noticed that many Felidae Beastkin prefer female healers, though they've never explained why. They also seem to have an uncanny ability to sense illness in others - I've had several patients who were diagnosed by their Felidae companions before showing symptoms.*

*The purring phenomenon deserves extensive study. I've observed accelerated healing in patients who receive regular "purr therapy" from Felidae friends. The vibrations seem to stimulate cellular regeneration in ways we don't fully understand.*

*‚Äî Healer Lydia Moonwhisper, Interspecies Medicine Specialist*

### Recent Clinical Discoveries

- **Purr frequency therapy** showing promise for bone density improvement
- **Scent mapping** being developed for early disease detection
- **Group therapy** with other Felidae showing remarkable success rates for anxiety disorders

### Cultural Medicine Integration

Felidae Beastkin communities have sophisticated grooming rituals that serve both social and medical functions. Their understanding of pressure point therapy through grooming has been incorporated into several mainstream healing practices.

<div class="medical-alert">
üìã **Cultural Sensitivity**: Many Felidae consider grooming assistance a deeply personal act. Always discuss grooming-related treatments with appropriate cultural sensitivity.
