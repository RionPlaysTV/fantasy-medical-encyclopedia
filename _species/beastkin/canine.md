## üß™ Pharmaceutical Considerations

### Toxic Substances (Fatal)
- **Chocolate/Cocoa**: Severe toxicity, cardiac arrest, seizures

### Dosage Considerations
- **Weight-based dosing**: Calculate using lean body mass, not total weight
- **Pack status affects metabolism**: Alphas often require higher doses
- **Stress levels impact absorption**: Anxious patients need adjusted timing
- **Seasonal variations**: Metabolism changes with coat cycles

## ü•º Pack-Sensitive Examination Protocols

### Pre-Examination Assessment
1. **Identify pack structure**: Who is alpha, who needs to be present
2. **Pack member consent**: Include relevant pack members in decisions
3. **Territory respect**: Allow patient to establish comfort zone
4. **Approach hierarchy**: Address alpha first, then patient if different

### Examination Techniques
- **Pack member present**: Essential for anxious or young patients
- **Scent introduction**: Allow patient to scent healer before contact
- **Calm voice tones**: Speak in low, reassuring tones
- **Body language awareness**: Avoid threatening postures
- **Respect submission signals**: Back off if patient shows submission

### Emergency Protocols
For unconscious or transformed patients:
- **Pack permission**: Get alpha consent for emergency treatment
- **Minimal restraint**: Use only when absolutely necessary
- **Pack comfort items**: Allow pack scent items near patient
- **Status updates**: Keep pack informed of patient condition

## üßÇ Nutritional Requirements

### Pack Feeding Dynamics
- **Hierarchy feeding**: Alphas may need to eat first in group settings
- **Sharing behaviors**: May attempt to share food with pack members
- **Competition stress**: Separate feeding may be necessary in medical settings
- **Food guarding**: Natural behavior, not aggression in medical context

### Dietary Essentials
- **High protein**: 60-70% of diet from animal sources
- **Balanced fats**: Essential for coat health and energy
- **Carbohydrates**: 20-30% for sustained energy, prefer complex carbs
- **Fiber**: Important for digestive health, prefer vegetable sources
- **Hydration**: Higher water needs than most species

### Meal Patterns
- **Frequency**: 2-3 large meals preferred over frequent small meals
- **Timing**: Regular schedule important for pack harmony
- **Speed**: May eat rapidly due to pack competition instincts
- **Temperature**: Prefer room temperature or slightly warm food

<div class="medical-alert warning">
‚ö†Ô∏è **Feeding Warning**: Never feed chocolate, grapes, or onions to Canidae Beastkin. Even small amounts can be fatal. Always verify ingredients in prepared foods.

## üìì Scholar's Notes

*Working with Canidae Beastkin has fundamentally changed my understanding of patient care. They've shown me that healing is not just about the individual - it's about their place in their community, their pack bonds, and their sense of belonging.*

*I've learned to always introduce myself to the entire pack, not just my patient. The alpha's approval makes treatment infinitely easier, and pack support dramatically improves recovery times. I've seen dying patients recover simply because their pack refused to let them go.*

*Their loyalty is both their greatest strength and their greatest vulnerability. I've treated Canidae who made themselves sick with worry over absent pack members, and others who ignored their own serious injuries to protect pack young.*

*The howling therapy is real and effective. I initially dismissed it as cultural superstition, but the frequency analysis shows clear therapeutic effects. I now recommend howling sessions as part of treatment protocols.*

*‚Äî Pack-Healer Marcus Moonhowl, Canidae Community Medicine*

### Research Developments

- **Pack bond neurology**: Studying the neurochemical basis of pack connections
- **Frequency healing**: Mapping therapeutic effects of different howling frequencies
- **Group immunity**: Evidence that pack bonds enhance immune system function
- **Stress cascade prevention**: Pack support reducing stress-related illness

### Cultural Integration

Canidae medical traditions emphasize community healing and collective responsibility for health. Their pack councils often serve as early intervention systems for both physical and mental health issues.

<div class="medical-alert">
üìã **Cultural Respect**: Pack decisions about medical care take precedence over individual choices in Canidae culture. Always work within pack structure for optimal outcomes.
