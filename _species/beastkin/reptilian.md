## üìì Scholar's Notes

*Reptilia Beastkin have taught me more about patience than any other species. Their approach to medicine is deliberate, long-term, and deeply connected to natural cycles. They've shown me that sometimes the best treatment is simply providing the right environment and allowing natural healing to occur.*

*The regenerative capabilities are truly remarkable. I've watched patients regrow entire limbs over the course of months, with perfect functionality restoration. The key is maintaining optimal conditions throughout the regeneration process.*

*Temperature is everything with Reptilia patients. I've learned to keep my clinic significantly warmer than comfortable for human patients, and I always have emergency warming protocols ready. A cold Reptilia patient is not just uncomfortable - they're dying.*

*Their longevity gives them a unique perspective on health and healing. They think in terms of decades and centuries, which can be frustrating when trying to address immediate concerns, but incredibly valuable for long-term treatment planning.*
