**üß¨ Lifespan:**  
2000-5000+ years with significant variation by dragon type and magical environment. Ancient Dragons (1000+ years) may achieve practical immortality through magical means. Chromatic Dragons typically have shorter lifespans due to violent lifestyles, while Metallic Dragons may reach 8000+ years through wisdom and restraint.

**üìè Physical Characteristics:**  
Enormous reptilian beings ranging from 20 feet (young adult) to 100+ feet (ancient wyrms) in length. Distinctive features include: massive wings with 2:1 wing-to-body ratio, breath weapon organs, armored scales providing natural protection, and magical organ clusters near the heart. Scale color indicates subspecies and magical affinities. Weight increases exponentially with age‚Äîancient dragons may weigh 200+ tons.

**ü´Ä Cardiovascular & Respiratory Systems:**  
**Extraordinarily complex physiology.** Dragons possess dual cardiovascular systems: a primary blood circulation system supporting massive physical structure, and a secondary magical circulation system that powers breath weapons and spell abilities. Heart chamber count varies by subspecies (4-12 chambers documented). 

Respiratory system includes specialized breath weapon organs:
- **Fire Dragons:** Internal magma chambers with heat-resistant tissue
- **Ice Dragons:** Cryogenic organ clusters that super-cool exhaled air  
- **Acid Dragons:** Concentrated acid production glands
- **Lightning Dragons:** Bio-electrical generation organs

**ü©∫ Common Ailments & Vulnerabilities:**  
- **Scale Rot:** Fungal infection that can spread rapidly across large body areas
- **Hoard Madness:** Psychological condition causing obsessive material accumulation
- **Magical Overload Syndrome:** Breath weapon overuse leading to organ damage
- **Ancient Memory Cascade:** Elderly dragons overwhelmed by centuries of accumulated memories
- **Territorial Displacement Stress:** Severe psychological/physical symptoms when forced from established lairs
- **Polymorphing Addiction:** Compulsive shape-changing leading to identity fragmentation

**‚ú® Magical Anomalies / Biological Adaptations:**  
Dragons are among the most magically powerful creatures in existence. Key adaptations include:
- **Innate Spellcasting:** Natural magical abilities increase with age
- **Damage Resistance:** Physical and magical attack immunity strengthens over time
- **Shape-changing:** Many dragons can assume humanoid forms
- **Magical Sensing:** Detection of magical auras and items across vast distances
- **Planar Awareness:** Some ancient dragons can sense dimensional fluctuations
- **Spell Immunity:** Elder dragons may become completely immune to certain magic schools

**Age-based magical development:**
- **Wyrmling (0-5 years):** Basic breath weapon
- **Young (6-100 years):** Simple spellcasting
- **Adult (101-800 years):** Advanced magical abilities
- **Ancient (800+ years):** Reality-altering capabilities

**üß™ Healing Response:**  
**EXTREME CAUTION REQUIRED.** Dragon physiology processes healing magic unpredictably:
- **Healing potions:** Require doses 50-100x normal amounts‚Äîoften more cost-effective to use magical items
- **Divine healing:** Effectiveness varies dramatically by dragon's alignment and the deity's domain
- **Natural regeneration:** Dragons heal remarkably quickly when left undisturbed in their lairs
- **Magical healing:** May interact dangerously with dragon's innate magical systems

**Critical Note:** Never attempt healing magic on a dragon without explicit consent‚Äîtheir magical defenses may interpret healing spells as attacks.

**ü•º Crossbreeding Compatibility:**  
- **Dragonborn lineages:** Stable humanoid descendants with diluted draconic traits
- **Half-dragons:** Direct crosses with humanoids, extremely rare but viable
- **Sorcerer bloodlines:** Distant draconic heritage manifesting as innate magical ability
- **Draconic familiars:** Magical bonds rather than biological reproduction

**Note:** Dragon reproduction often involves centuries-long courtship rituals and may require specific magical or environmental conditions.

**üßÇ Allergies / Magical Toxins:**  
- **Anti-magic fields:** Cause severe discomfort and may trigger aggressive responses
- **Opposing elemental forces:** Fire dragons vulnerable to extreme cold, etc.
- **Dragon-bane weapons:** Specifically enchanted items designed to harm dragons
- **Imprisonment spells:** Cause claustrophobic panic responses in most dragons
- **Forced polymorph:** Magical shape-changing imposed against their will
- **Silence effects:** Prevents spellcasting and breath weapons, causing distress

**üåø Cultural Medical Practices:**  
- **Lair Healing:** Dragons prefer to heal within their carefully prepared magical lairs
- **Treasure Therapy:** Interaction with hoarded magical items provides psychological comfort
- **Solitary Recovery:** Most dragons reject external medical intervention
- **Draconic Councils:** Ancient dragons occasionally consult with peers on medical issues
- **Magical Item Integration:** Using collected magical items as prosthetics or healing aids
- **Generational Memory Sharing:** Learning healing techniques from inherited memories

**üìì Scholar's Notes:**  
*"I have had the extraordinary privilege of treating exactly one dragon in my career‚Äîa young brass dragon with an infected wing wound. The 'consultation' lasted six hours, mostly consisting of the dragon questioning my credentials, my magical lineage, and my intentions. The actual healing took thirty seconds once I gained permission to proceed. Dragons don't need doctors‚Äîthey need diplomats."*

**Clinical Observation:** Dragons view most medical problems as temporary inconveniences beneath their notice. They may ignore serious injuries for decades, allowing natural healing to occur. However, conditions affecting their magical abilities or hoards receive immediate attention.

**Emergency Protocol:** 
1. **Establish communication immediately**‚Äînever approach unconscious dragons
2. **Maintain respectful distance**‚Äîminimum 100 feet for safety
3. **Announce your intentions clearly**‚Äîdragons can detect deception
4. **Offer tribute or payment**‚Äîdragons rarely accept "free" healing
5. **Prepare for magical effects**‚Äîdragon presence may disrupt medical equipment
6. **Have escape plan ready**‚Äîdragon mood can change rapidly
7. **Consult draconic law codes**‚Äîhealing dragons may create obligation bonds

**ABSOLUTE WARNING:** Never attempt to sedate or magically restrain a dragon. This will be interpreted as an attack and likely result in immediate retaliation. Even young dragons possess enough magical power to level buildings.
