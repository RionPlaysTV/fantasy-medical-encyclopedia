## üìì Scholar's Notes

*In thirty years of magical medicine, nothing prepared me for my first dragon patient. Ancient Pyraxis the Red came to me with what he described as "a minor scale irritation." The "minor" irritation covered an area larger than my entire clinic.*

*Dragons are simultaneously the easiest and most difficult patients imaginable. Easy because they often understand their own physiology better than any healer could. Difficult because their magical presence can disrupt every piece of equipment, and one wrong word can end the consultation permanently.*

*I've learned that dragons appreciate intellectual honesty above all else. If you don't know something, admit it. They've seen enough centuries to recognize competence, and they have no patience for pretense.*

*The relationship between dragons and their hoards is far more complex than simple greed. I've observed genuine health improvements in dragons who organize their hoards, and corresponding health declines in those whose hoards are disturbed.*

*‚Äî Arcane Healer Valdris Dragonspeak, Ancient Creature Medicine*

*"I have had the extraordinary privilege of treating exactly one dragon in my career‚Äîa young brass dragon with an infected wing wound. The 'consultation' lasted six hours, mostly consisting of the dragon questioning my credentials, my magical lineage, and my intentions. The actual healing took thirty seconds once I gained permission to proceed. Dragons don't need doctors‚Äîthey need diplomats."*

*‚ÄîMaster Healer Korrath Ironscale, Draconic Medicine Specialist*

**Clinical Observation**: Dragons view most medical problems as temporary inconveniences beneath their notice. They may ignore serious injuries for decades, allowing natural healing to occur. However, conditions affecting their magical abilities or hoards receive immediate attention.

### Recent Research Developments

- **Scale regeneration**: Studying draconic healing for applications to armored species
- **Magical metabolism**: Understanding how dragons process pure magical energy
- **Longevity research**: Investigating draconic aging mechanisms
- **Elemental immunity**: Developing magical protections based on draconic physiology

### Cultural Considerations

Dragon medicine must account for their ancient cultures, territorial behaviors, and complex social hierarchies. Treatment often involves negotiating with dragon councils and respecting territorial boundaries.

<div class="medical-alert">
üìã **Cultural Protocol**: Always approach dragon medicine as diplomatic negotiation first, medical consultation second. The patient's cooperation is more valuable than any treatment.
</div>

## Emergency Protocol
1. **Establish communication immediately**‚Äînever approach unconscious dragons
2. **Maintain respectful distance**‚Äîminimum 100 feet for safety
3. **Announce your intentions clearly**‚Äîdragons can detect deception
4. **Offer tribute or payment**‚Äîdragons rarely accept "free" healing
5. **Prepare for magical effects**‚Äîdragon presence may disrupt medical equipment
6. **Have escape plan ready**‚Äîdragon mood can change rapidly
7. **Consult draconic law codes**‚Äîhealing dragons may create obligation bonds

**ABSOLUTE WARNING**: Never attempt to sedate or magically restrain a dragon. This will be interpreted as an attack and likely result in immediate retaliation. Even young dragons possess enough magical power to level buildings.

**Critical Note**: Never attempt healing magic on a dragon without explicit consent‚Äîtheir magical defenses may interpret healing spells as attacks.
