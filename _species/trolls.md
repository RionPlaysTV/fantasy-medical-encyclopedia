## üìì Scholar's Notes

*Trolls have completely revolutionized my understanding of regenerative medicine. Watching a troll regrow a severed arm over the course of three weeks was the most remarkable medical event of my career. Their healing capabilities seem to defy basic biological principles.*

*The cultural aspects of troll medicine are as important as the physical. I've learned that a troll's connection to their territory is not just psychological - it's physiological. Trolls separated from their home environments show measurably slower healing rates.*

*Their fear of fire goes far beyond simple vulnerability. Fire represents the one force that can truly harm them permanently. I've seen ancient trolls with fire scars from centuries ago that still cause them daily pain.*

*The regeneration overflow syndrome is particularly fascinating. It suggests that their healing abilities can be 'overcharged' to the point of malfunction. This has led to new research into controlled regenerative therapy for other species.*
